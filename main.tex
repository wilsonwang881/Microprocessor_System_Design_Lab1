\part{Introduction}

The first lab session of ECEN 749 aims to familiarize the students with basic operations using the \textit{Zybo Z7-20: Zynq-7000 ARM/FPGA SoC Development Board} and to refresh students' memory on Verilog HDL. The lab uses \textit{Xilinx Vivado 2015.2} as the development tool for generating bitstream and communicating with the FPGA board.

    \item After selecting the \textbf{switch.v} file in the \textbf{Source} panel, click on \textbf{Generate Bitstream} under the \textbf{PROGRAM AND DEBUG} tab from the \textbf{Flow Navigator} panel. Click \textbf{Yes} if there were any warnings.
    
    \item Set the jumper \textbf{JP5} on the FPGA board to \textbf{JTAG}.
    
    \item Connect the power adaptor to the wall plug and the FPGA board. Flip on the power switch on the FPGA board.
    
    \item Click on \textbf{Open Hardware Manager} under the \textbf{PROGRAM AND DEBUG} tab from the \textbf{Flow Navigator} panel.

    \item Toggle the switches to see the effect of switching on and off the LEDs.
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Button-Controlled Counter}

Procedures for this experiment is the same as those for the previous experiment, except the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project is named as \textbf{Counter}.
    
    % \item define module difference should be addressed here.
    
    % \item code: the counter.v file
    
    % \item code: the counter.xdc file.
    
    % list the names of the switches
    
    \item To see the effect, keep pressing one of the two switches and notice the LEDs are acting as a counter displaying binary numbers. The period is approximately one second.
    
    % explain how to achieve the exactly one second counting period here.
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Jackpot Game}

Procedures for this experiment is the same as those for the first experiment, except the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Project is named as \textbf{Counter}.
    
    \item
    
      % \item define module difference should be addressed here.
    
    % \item code: the counter.v file
    
    % \item code: the counter.xdc file.
    
    % list the names of the switches
    
    \item To see the effect, flip on the switch that is directly below the LED that is on. All LEDs should start flashing at the same time if the correct switch is toggled.
    
    % explain the period used here
    
\end{enumerate}

\part{Results}

\section{Switch-Operated LED Array}

The outcome is as expected. When flipping the switch, an LED corresponding to that particular switch lights on and off as the switch is turned on and off. Lighting up multiple LEDs is possible and each switch does not interfere with the operation other switches and LEDs.

% add a picture here

% add the simulation results here

\section{Button-Controlled Counter}

% specify the names of the buttons here

% double check the conditions, i.e. down-counting from 0 will not result in 1111

The outcome is as expected. When pressing the button for up counter, the binary number represented by the LEDs counts up and vice versa. When the LEDs are all on, representing a binary number of 0'b1111, pressing the up-counting button results in a counting cycle starting from 0. The counter has a capacity of 4 bits and when it overflows, it restarts from 0. When all the LEDs are off, representing a binary number of 0'b0000, pressing the down-counting button will not switch on or off any LEDs. Down-counting from 0 yields 0.

\section{Jackpot Game}

% alter the speed of the one-hot fashion switching of the LEDs

The outcome is as expected. The LEDs are switched on and off in one-hot fashion at a constant interval. When all LEDs are switched on once, a new cycle starts from the first LED that is switched on. While LEDs are being switch on and off, flipping the switch that corresponds to the on-state LED ends the game. After the game ends, all LEDs are turned on and off at the same time, indicating a winning situation has been reached. Flipping the switch after winning the game does not change anything. The player cannot win the game by turning on multiple switches.

\part{Conclusion}

From this lab session, I have learned how to use the \textbf{Xilinx Vivado} design suite to make hardware design and run the design on a FPGA board. I have refreshed my memory on writing Verilog by doing those three experiments.

My approach was primarily based on a software-programming perspective instead of the hardware way. Each piece of Verilog code should correspond to hardware blocks that can be manufactured. Hence I ran into some issues like not using \textbf{reg} in an \textbf{always} block. Thinking from a software perspective works for this lab session but may expose vulnerabilities when it comes to large and complex hardware design. 

Q: How are the user push-buttons wired on the ZYBO Z7-10 board?

A: According to \href{https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/zybo-z7/reference-manual}{https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/zybo-z7/reference-manual}:

Edit the \textit{.xdc} file in the following format:

\lstinputlisting[style={txt-style}]{xdc.txt}

Q: What is the purpose of an edge detection circuit and how should it have been used in this lab?

A: An edge detection circuit generates a pulse signal when its input waveform is rising or falling. The edge detector circult can be used in the counter design. In my code, there are multiple places where the \textbf{posedge} keyword is used when writing the \textbf{always} block. The edge detection circuit can be used when connecting the clock and the counter circuit, or as the connection between the counter and the jackpot circuit.
